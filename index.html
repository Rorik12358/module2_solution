			<h2 id="title1">Chicken</h2>
			<p>Peel and finely slice the garlic. Pick the basil leaves, then finely chop the stalks.

Heat a splash of oil in a medium saucepan over a medium heat. Add the garlic and basil stalks and cook for 2 minutes, or until golden. 

Tip the tinned tomatoes into the pan and squash them down with the back of a spoon. Fill the empty tomato tin with water and pour this in too. Season and simmer for 30 minutes, or until reduced, glossy and thick. 

Place the chicken breasts on a board and cover with a double layer of clingfilm. Bash with a saucepan to flatten them to 5mm thick. 

Tip the flour into one bowl, then crack and beat the eggs in a second bowl. Add the breadcrumbs to a third, finely grate in half of the Parmesan, then shake to combine. 

Coat the chicken in the flour, then the egg and finally in the cheesy breadcrumbs, until thoroughly coated. 

Heat a lug of oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and cook the chicken for 3 to 4 mins on each side, or until golden and the meat is cooked through. 

Cook the spaghetti according to the packet instructions, then drain and add to the tomato sauce, loosening with a little of the cooking water if needed. 

Serve the pasta alongside the crispy chicken, with the remaining Parmesan and basil leaves scattered over.</p>

			<h2 id="title2">Beef</h2>
			<p>Let the meat come to room temperature for 1 hr before you roast it. Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Dry the meat with kitchen paper, then rub the oil all over it. Mix the mustard powder with the sea salt and 1 tsp pepper, then rub this over the meat too. Lay the carrots in a large roasting tin to make a trivet and sit the beef on top, fat-side up.
			Roast for 15 mins, then turn the heat down to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and roast for another 55 mins. This will give you medium beef; for medium-rare, cook for 45 mins. (When itâ€™s done, a probe thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the beef should read 65C).
			With 30 mins cooking time left, baste the beef in the fat that has pooled in the tin, add the shallots and bay leaves, and coat these in the fat too. Season and return to the oven. Meanwhile, boil the wine in a small saucepan to reduce it by two-thirds.
			When the meat is ready, transfer to a board, cover loosely with foil and leave to rest. Turn the oven up to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and return the tin to the oven for a further 10-15 mins until the shallots are tender.
			Scoop out the shallots with a slotted spoon and set aside to keep warm. Remove the excess fat from the tin and discard, leaving 1 tbsp fat and all the dark juices behind. Add the flour and cook on the hob for 2 mins, stirring constantly.</p>

			<h2 id="title3">Sushi</h2>
			<p>I tend to categorize American sushi restaurants into two buckets: traditional places where you can get a wide selection of fresh nigiri sushi, and the non-traditional places that have pages upon pages of inventive makisushi. If I had to choose between the two, I'd take the one with the stoic Japanese dude forming little pillows of rice with a thin slice of aquatic bliss on top, but that's not to say I don't enjoy the raucous places with frat boys slinging sake bombs, phonebook sized menus, and of course the California Roll. As the name implies, California Rolls were invented in the late 1960's by a creative sushi chef in Los Angeles. Lamenting the lack of sushi grade fish in the US he decided to turn to ingredients that were readily available for his new creation. The avocado approximates the rich creaminess of toro (tuna belly), while the use of crab is a nod to the abundance of Dungeness Crab along the left coast. Rolling the rice on the outside and the nori on the inside, was an innovation designed to appease customers who balked at the notion of eating seaweed at a time when sushi was amongst the most exotic of foods.</p>
